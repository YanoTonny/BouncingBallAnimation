# Bouncing Ball Animation

A simple Python project that simulates a bouncing ball using the `turtle` graphics library. The ball bounces off the edges of the screen and is affected by gravity, creating a realistic animation.

## Features

- Smooth animation loop with continuous updates
- Ball bounces off the edges of the screen
- Gravity affects the ball's vertical movement
- Energy loss on each bounce for realistic effect

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `turtle` module (included in Python standard library)

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BouncingBallAnimation.git
   cd BouncingBallAnimation
   ```

2. Run the script:
   ```sh
   python bouncing_ball.py
   ```

## Description

This project demonstrates basic principles of animation in Python, including:

- Updating object positions
- Handling collisions with screen edges
- Simulating physical effects like gravity and energy loss
